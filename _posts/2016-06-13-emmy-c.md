Anyway, that was a slightly horrifying trip down memory lane for me, but hopefully you have enjoyed it! I would say my art has evolved a LOT over the years, and in some ways not at all! I might get technically better, but I don't push myself out of my comfort zones too often, which I need to work on for sure. I am certainly glad I no longer shade with dodge and burn!
